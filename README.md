Statistics Linear Correlation Coefficent Guesser

I made this for a friend because he's in stats.

Just guess what the [linear correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation) is of the points. Positive and near 1 is going up, and very high correlation. Negative 1 is the same thing, but the line has a negative slope.

This is the original one that I was inspired by. Please check it out [here](https://www.rossmanchance.com/applets/2021/guesscorrelation/GuessCorrelation.html).
